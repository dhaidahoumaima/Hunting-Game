# Hunting-Game
Hunting is a two-player game played on an n x n board, where one player takes on the role of the fugitive,
and the other player plays as the hunter. The objective of the fugitive is to evade capture, while the hunter's goal is to surround 
and capture the fugitive within at most 4n steps.
# Game Rules
1- The game starts with the fugitive at the center of the board and the hunter's characters positioned at each corner.
2- Players take turns moving their character one step on the board, with the hunter having four characters to choose from.
3- The fugitive wins if they can avoid capture by the hunter until the end of the game.
4- The hunter wins if they manage to surround the fugitive within 4n steps, preventing the fugitive from moving further.
# Board Size
The game allows you to select the board size, which can be one of the following options:
3x3 (turns: 12)
5x5 (turns: 20)
7x7 (turns: 28)
# Game End
The game automatically recognizes when it ends. If the hunter successfully surrounds the fugitive, a message box will appear, declaring the hunter as the winner. If the game ends without a winner, it will be considered a draw, and the players can start a new game.
